# The Ultimate Abitur Code Repository 📚

## Introduction
Hey everyone! Welcome to our Abitur code stash, where we all put together our brilliant (and sometimes not-so-brilliant) pieces of code. But watch out! It's under the supervision of Mr. Big, the caveman who somehow figured out how to teach in the 21st century. 🦖

## Mr. Big's Wohnzimmer 🪓
Ah yes, the Wohnzimmer—where the magic happens. This is Mr. Big's kingdom, a place where fire was just discovered yesterday and the wheel is still square. Seriously, we learn to code amidst rock paintings and hieroglyphics. But don't worry, his laptop is not made of stone (we checked).

## What's Inside? 📦
- `JavaJungle/`: Caveman-approved Java exercises
- `PythonPond/`: Python code that even Mr. Big can understand
- `StoneWeb/`: HTML and CSS files (because rocks need websites too)
- `RubyRocks/`: Pun intended

## Rules 📜
1. No fire allowed. Mr. Big is still scared of it.
2. Try not to invent any new tools; it confuses him.
3. Your code must be approved by the tribe council (aka pull request reviews).

## How to Contribute 🤝
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your own cave (branch).
3. Add your shiny tools (code).
4. Make an offering to the council (pull request).

## Credits 👏
Special thanks to Mr. Big for discovering the `return` statement last week. We are forever in your debt.
